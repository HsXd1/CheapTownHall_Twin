## Overview

In today's age, it's harder than ever for university students to find internships or jobs. Our web app, **TWIN!**, aims to empower students by enabling them to seamlessly connect with and apply to open positions from a multitude of job-searching platforms.

##  How It’s Made

**Tech Stack:**  
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- Node.js  
- Figma

Our team identified a growing need: university students trying to break into an increasingly competitive job market. To make our product engaging and intuitive, we drew inspiration from social media platforms favored by Gen Z and Millennials.

We incorporated UI/UX elements from:
- **Tinder** (swipe left/right mechanics)
- **TikTok** (attention-grabbing interface)

Job and internship postings were sourced from platforms like **Handshake** and **LinkedIn**.  
To bring our vision to life:
- Our frontend developer used AI tools to convert Figma designs into functional HTML.
- We implemented a scraper to pull relevant job data from multiple sites.

##  Out of Time

Working within a 24-hour window, we faced several challenges that limited the full implementation of our vision:

- **Frontend:** Translating Figma designs into HTML was difficult without AI assistance, especially given our limited CSS experience.
- **Backend:** Scraping was complicated by dynamic website structures, making it tough to consistently fetch and display the necessary data points.

##  Lessons Learned

This was the first hackathon for every member of our team, and while we underestimated the difficulty and overestimated our available time, we walked away with invaluable experiences:

- Hands-on work with HTML and web design
- Building and debugging web scrapers
- Collaborative use of Figma
- And much more...

Despite the setbacks, the experience was incredibly rewarding and gave us a taste of what real-world, fast-paced development looks like.
